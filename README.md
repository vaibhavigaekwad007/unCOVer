# NASA Space Apps Challenge - COIVD-19 
A two day virtual hackathon organized by NASA across the globe. Objective is to tackle COVID-19 using data from NASA, ESA, JAXA, CSA, and CNES and develop solutions around and about the virus and its spread using space-based data and understand the impacts of COVID-19 on the Earth system and Earth's response.

unCOVer and analyze COVID-19 data compared to air quality, population density, and more.

# About
Our projectâ€™s objectives were to monitor and track COVID-19 outbreaks, determine a relationship between environmental factors and pandemic spread, assess high-risk areas for the disease, and depict the data in an interactive, insightful and easily-accessible manner. We generated a website designed to visualize relationships between environmental factors (e.g. air pollution severity, temperature, population density, as well as other factors) and reported COVID-19 cases and fatalities within specific regions. Alongiwith that an interactive Tableau Dashboard was created to understand the air quality across the globe over the past few months of pandemic. During the creation of our final project, we used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, and Python as well as the data tool Tableau.

# Limitations and Future scope
One limitation of our solution was the availability of recent data related to air pollution levels, which affects the relevance of the displayed data. However, this data can be updated once the 2020 Environmental Performance Index is released (June 4, 11 AM). Additionally, the risk determination does not take the efficacy of social distancing measures into account, which significantly affects rates of virus transmission.
